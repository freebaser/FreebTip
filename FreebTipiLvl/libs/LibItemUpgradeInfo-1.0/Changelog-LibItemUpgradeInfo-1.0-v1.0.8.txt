Tagging as v1.0.8


--------------------

Kevin Ballard:
	- Get the "true" item level for heirlooms
	This has to scan a tooltip for the heirloom, since there seems to be no
	other way to get the item level. The results are cached for each item
	link to avoid scanning tooltips unnecessarily. Only heirlooms are
	scanned this way.
	
	A new function lib:GetHeirloomTrueLevel() can be used to get the "true"
	item level for an heirloom, and lib:GetUpgradedItemLevel() was modified
	to call this method.
	
	Bump version to v1.0.8.
